       <P>
    Hi! My name is Lauren Kramer and I am a junior in the iSchool at Syracuse University majoring in 
    <br> <strong> Information Management and Technology </strong> with a concentration in Data Analytics. 
    <br> I am also minoring in Retail Management in the Whitman School of Management. I enjoy <li>traveling</li> 
    <br> exercising, cooking, and spending time with my friends and family. This summer I was fortunate 
    <br> enough to intern at a firm in NYC where I explored technology in the business world. This gave 
    <br> me insight on the importance of data and taught me valuable skills that I am able to apply to 
    <br> classwork and future jobs.
       </p>
