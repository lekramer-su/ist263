            Welcome! My name is Lauren Kramer and I am here to tell you about my journey. I struggle with an elevated ESR, (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate), which causes me to constantly feel achey. <br> After numerous doctor visits, screenings, and blood tests, my physicians are still unsure what is
            causing my inflammation and the exact way to cure it. Due to this, I have been experimenting with trial and error to find out what helps me most. While we are still unsure what exactly is helping the most, here is a look at part of my secret remedy!
