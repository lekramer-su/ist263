            Prior to taking all the natural supplements that I have discussed, my body just never seemed to feel right. I always felt that I was under the weather, yet when I visited my doctor, they could  never provide me with an official diagnosis. Even though I was getting enough sleep, I was constantly lethargic. My joints seemed to hurt and I always complained about an overall achiness. My throat also bothered me frequently. Finally, I visited a rheumatologist and after a battery of tests, he noticed that my inflammation level was raised.
