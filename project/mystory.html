            After meeting with the rheumatologist, he developed a plan for me. The first supplement that he thought would be most beneficial was turmeric. Turmeric is an excellent anti-inflammatory that I take daily. Even though some foods contain turmeric, it is important to take it as a supplement if you want the full benefit it provides. The doctor also gave me a long list of other anti-inflammatories and immunity boosting supplements that I take daily. He also suggested certain foods, such as certain fish which provides omega-3 fatty acids, leafy greens and a low sugar diet. After being on this specific regimen for approximately 2 months, I started to notice a huge difference in how I felt. I have a lot more energy than I did before. I am hardly achy and my throat does not hurt as much. I feel like a new person! The combination of supplements, diet and a regular exercise regimen has changed my life for the better. Although I take approximately 13 pills a day, it is a small price to pay to feel like myself!
