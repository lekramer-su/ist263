    Hi! My name is Lauren Kramer and I am a junior in the iSchool at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Data Analytics. I am also minoring in Retail Management in the Whitman School of Management. I enjoy traveling, exercising, cooking, and spending time with my friends and family. This summer I was fortunate enough to intern at a firm in NYC where I explored technology in the business world. This gave me insight on the importance of data and taught me valuable skills that I am able to apply to classwork and future jobs.
